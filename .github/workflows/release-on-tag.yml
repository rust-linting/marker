  # This job is the result of desperation. Unfortunatelly we can't easily cross-compile
  # the driver for ARM targets, because we need to have the `rustc_private` DLLs to
  # be compiled for ARM, but their proc macros need to be compiled for the host x86_64
  # architecture. However, this isn't the case today, and those proc macros are distributed
  # pre-compiled only for the architecture of the target machine by `rustup`.
  #
  # So this job uses docker + QEMU to emulate an ARM machine and build the driver there.
  # This, however, is a very slow process, and it's not possible to use this approach
  # to build the driver for windows and macos that easily. I have high confidence it's
  # possible to hack something for windows, but given the Apple's closed ecosystem...
  #
  # I don't think it's reasonably possible to compile for macos ARM. They really want
  # you to buy their hardware. There is a gossip that GitHub will provide Apple M1 managed
  # runners somewhere in the observable future, but until that happens the only option
  # to compile for macos on ARM is to buy an Apple M1 machine and make a self-hosted runner,
  # but that is ridiculously expensive.
