//! The [`marker_api`] crate is designed to be driver-independent and lightweight.
//! Communication from the lint-crate to the driver is done via structs inside the
//! [`marker_api::context`] module. For example, [`marker_api::MarkerContext`].
//!
//! The communication needs to be ABI safe, since it goes over an FFI function
//! boundary. For this reason, it's not (directly) possible to use `dyn Trait`objects.
//! Marker instead uses `*Callback` structs, that contain function pointers, which can
//! be filled by the driver. This is like a `dyn Trait` object, without all the nice
//! syntax and build in compiler support.
//!
//! These `*Callbacks` structs need to be filled and some ABI-specific transformations
//! have to be performed. This module hides all the gore behind some structs and
//! traits, which can be implemented by the specific driver. The following is an
//! explanation of this structure and some naming conventions. The explanation will use
//! an imaginary `Magic` struct, to illustrate the structure:
//!
//! * The `marker_api` crate defines the `Magic` struct with an interface for external and internal
//!   consumers.
//!
//!    It also defines the `MagicCallbacks` struct, which stores function pointers.
//!    All `*Callbacks` structs have a special `data: &'ast MarkerContextData` field that will be
//!    passed to all stored function pointers, as the first argument. All function
//!    pointers are marked as `extern "C"` and need to use FFI safe types. Lifetimes
//!    are allowed by Rust, but not enforced over FFI bounds.
//!
//! * The `marker_adapter` crate defines a `MagicDriver` trait, that has all the functions, needed
//!   to provide a backend for the `Magic` struct.
//!
//!    It also defines the `MagicWrapper` struct, that has a `driver: &'ast dyn
//!    MagicDriver` field. This struct will be used to fill the `MagicCallbacks.data`
//!    field. Wrapping it in a separate `*Wrapper` struct makes the `&'ast *Wrapper`
//!    pointer a thin pointer and cleans up the interface.
//!
//!    The `marker_adapter` module containing the `MagicWrapper` struct defines a
//!    bunch of `extern "C"` functions, which build the counterpart to the `extern
//!    "C"` functions inside `MagicCallbacks`. These functions cast the `data`
//!    argument into the `&'ast MagicWrapper` instance it originated from and calls
//!    the corresponding trait function from the `driver: &'ast dyn MagicDriver` field
//!    stored inside the `Wrapper` struct. The `extern "C"` functions are also
//!    responsible for converting all types into FFI safe types and back.
//!
//! * The driver simply implements the `MagicDriver` trait and instantiates `MagicWrapper`. This
//!   wrapper instance is then used to fill `MagicCallbacks` and instantiate the `Magic` struct from
//!   `marker_api`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Short Q&A with @xFrednet
//!
//! * **Isn't there a simpler way?**
//!
//!     Most likely... Or better say hopefully there is.
//!
//!     However, I couldn't find one. Most libraries I found either didn't support these
//!     types of callbacks, were experimental, or are unsound.
//!
//!     I also have high hopes for Rust adding some cross crate boundary communication
//!     support some time in the future. But there is no point in waiting on this. There
//!     are lints which need to be written, and we can always replace this infrastructure
//!     later.
//!
//! * **Isn't there a simpler way to make the types FFI safe?**
//!
//!     Not really. There are some tools to generate ABI safe types, but they are geared
//!     towards C/C++ consumers. As a result, they usually lose lifetime information,
//!     which we want to keep since both sides are using Rust.
//!
//!     There are also crates that rely on serialization. A nice and simple solution, but
//!     not feasible for an entire AST over multiple FFI boundaries for every lint crate.
//!
//! * **Do you use code generation for all this infrastructure?**
//!
//!     I would love to! However, I haven't found the time to implement this. Normal macro
//!     rules are basically out of the question due to all the required FFI type
//!     transformation.
//!
//!     If anyone is interested in implementing this, I would be grateful!!! See
//!     rust-marker/marker#122
//!
//! * **Is this implementation even safe and sound?**
//!
//!     Theoretically speaking? From my understanding? Yes, it is, assuming that both sides
//!     reconstruct the lifetimes correctly.
//!
//!     Practically speaking? It wouldn't surprise me if there were several bugs. So far,
//!     it has been working suspiciously well, but I won't complain.

// The lifetimes are destroyed by unsafe, but help with readability

///
/// `&dyn` objects are theoretically not FFI safe since their type layout can
/// change and calling functions on them would require a stable ABI which Rust
/// doesn't provide.
///
/// In this case, the [`MarkerContextWrapper`] will be passed as a `*const ()`
/// pointer to [`MarkerContextCallbacks`] which will do nothing with this data other
/// than giving it back to functions declared in this module. Since the `&dyn`
/// object is created, only used here and everything is compiled during the same
/// compiler run, it should be safe to use `&dyn`.
