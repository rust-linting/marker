*cargo_marker* is the CLI tool for [Marker], an experimental linting interface for Rust. It seamlessly integrates with the Rust compiler to provide custom linting capabilities for your Rust projects.

> **Note**
>
> Marker is in the early stages of development, some things are still missing and the API is still unstable.
>
> A list of limitations and planned features can be found in [Marker's Readme].

## Key Features

* **Simple CLI**: *cargo_marker* does all the heavy lifting for you, making custom code analysis, as simple as a single console command.
* **Seamless Integration**: *cargo_marker* reuses Rust's existing infrastructure for linting, running Marker as part of your workflow is close to the effort needed for its sibling *[Clippy]*.
* **Automatic Lint-Crate Compilation**: *cargo_marker* automatically fetches and builds specified lint crates, streamlining the process of incorporating additional linting rules into your project.
* **User-Friendly Setup**: *cargo_marker* can automatically set up the driver and toolchain, allowing you to focus on writing quality code. (This version will setup rustc's driver for `nightly-2023-10-05`)
