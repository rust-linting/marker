*cargo_marker* is the CLI tool for [Marker], an experimental linting interface for Rust. It seamlessly integrates with the Rust compiler to provide custom linting capabilities for your Rust projects.

> **Note**
>
> Marker is in the early stages of development, some things are still missing and the API is still unstable.
>
> A list of limitations and planned features can be found in [Marker's Readme].

## Key Features

* **Simple CLI**: *cargo_marker* does all the heavy lifting for you, making custom code analysis, as simple as a single console command.
* **Seamless Integration**: *cargo_marker* reuses Rust's existing infrastructure for linting, running Marker as part of your workflow is close to the effort needed for its sibling *[Clippy]*.
* **Automatic Lint-Crate Compilation**: *cargo_marker* automatically fetches and builds specified lint crates, streamlining the process of incorporating additional linting rules into your project.
* **User-Friendly Setup**: *cargo_marker* can automatically set up the driver and toolchain, allowing you to focus on writing quality code. (This version will setup rustc's driver for `nightly-2023-08-24`)

## Usage

<!-- Please keep this section in sync with the main readme -->

The following is an abbreviated guide. Check out [The Marker Book] for detailed instructions and additional information.

### Installation

```sh
cargo install cargo_marker

# Automatically setup the toolchain and driver
cargo marker setup --auto-install-toolchain
```

### Specifying lints

Marker requires lint crates to be specified. The best way is to add them to the `Cargo.toml` file, like this:

<!-- region replace-version stable -->
```toml
[workspace.metadata.marker.lints]
# A local crate as a path
marker_lints = { path = './marker_lints' }
# An external crate via git
marker_lints = { git = "https://github.com/rust-marker/marker" }
# An external crate from a registry
marker_lints = "0.2.1"
```
<!-- endregion replace-version stable -->

### Running Marker

Running Marker is as simple as running its sibling *[Clippy]*. Navigate to your Rust project directory and run the following command:

```sh
cargo marker
```

This will initialize Marker, compile the lint crates and start linting.
