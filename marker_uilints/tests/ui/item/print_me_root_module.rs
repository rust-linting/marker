//! This is so hacky, and I love it! So what is this test?
//! Well, uilints has a test, which prints items that start with `print_me`,
//! and the root module of a crate has the name of the crate. So, my naming the
//! file `print_me_*` we have created a test case, that prints the root module
//! automatically. :D

fn main() {}
