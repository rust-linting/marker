# try to use any new features.

# unix `install.sh` script. If you modify this script, please check if the modifications
# should also apply to the unix one.

# This script can run on unix too if you have PowerShell installed there.

# `curl` for `Invoke-WebRequest`, and if you want to use the real curl, then
# you have to use `curl.exe`. That's a really perplexing design decision. Why
# would you alias `Invoke-WebRequest` to `curl` when it's not a real drop-in
# replacement for curl? Anyway.. PowerShell 7 removed that alias.
# More details here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/75867014
#
# Btw. this condition is written specically so that it can run on PowerShell 5,
# In PowerShell 7 there are automatic variables `$IsWindows`, `$IsMacOS`, `$IsLinux`.

# You, my friend will be surprised. But the workability of this entire
# script depends on the presence of this comment. I'm not joking. If you remove
# this comment the script won't work. The try block higher won't be executed.
# That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life, really.
#
# The reason is that if you pipe this script to a PowerShell interpreter, then
# that interpreter will not execute a multiline expression (which try block is)
# unless that expression is followed by two blank lines.
#
# You can test this with `Get-Content .\scripts\release\install.ps1 | powershell -command -`
#
# That's crazy, but this bug has been not fixed since 2017 when it was reported:
# https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3223
