# This script downloads the `cargo-marker` and the `marker_rustc_driver`
# binaries from the GitHub release assets. It also sets up the required
# Rust toolchain that the `marker_rustc_driver` depends on.
#
# This script must be self-contained! Nothing here should use anything from
# the marker repository, because users are expected to run this script on
# their machines where they don't have the marker repository cloned.
#
# It's possible to run this script on Linux if you have PowerShell installed there.
# An important caveat is that you'll likely install the latest PowerShell 7.0 on linux,
# but on real Windows 10/11 the version of PowerShell is quite old (5.1), so don't
# try to use any new features.
#
# This script is specifically for windows, but has a similar structure to the
# unix `install.sh` script. If you modify this script, please check if the modifications
# should also apply to the unix one.
#
# General PowerShell notes:
#
# Since we have $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop" the script will stop at any `Write-Error`.
# Yeah, writing an error log counts as an error. Who could expect that? Regardless of how
# unintuitive it is we use `Write-Error` instead of `throw` because the error that is generated
# this way is more readable, because it refers to the call site of the function where the error
# was written and not to the `throw` statement itself in the code snippet that is output.
#
# Example error output with `throw` shows the `throw` statement itself, not the call site:
# ```
# Line |
#   74 |          throw "Command $cmd failed with exit code $LASTEXITCODE"
#      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#      | Command curl failed with exit code 22
# ```
# Example error output with `Write-Error` shows the call site of the function which is more useful:
# ```
# Line |
#  174 |      Step curl$exe `
#      |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#      | Command curl failed with exit code 22
# ```

# You, my friend will be surprised. But the workability of this entire

# this comment the script won't work. The try block higher won't be executed.
# That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life, really.
#
# The reason is that if you pipe this script to a PowerShell interpreter, then
# that interpreter will not execute a multiline expression (which try block is)
# unless that expression is followed by two blank lines.
#
# You can test this with `Get-Content .\scripts\release\install.ps1 | powershell -command -`
#
# That's crazy, but this bug has been not fixed since 2017 when it was reported:
