# The Rust Code of Conduct

Marker follows [Rust's Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html). For violation reports or moderation requests, please contact a member of the rust-marker organization and not the *Rust moderation team* as Marker is currently not an official rust-lang project. For complex cases or on request, a neutral third party can be included as a mediator.
